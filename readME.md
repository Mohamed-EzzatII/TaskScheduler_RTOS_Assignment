# RTOS Assignment 1

## Objectives 
- In this assignment, you will use the TaskScheduler library to implement and manage real-time tasks on an Arduino or ATmega328 microcontroller. The goal is to deepen your understanding of real-time scheduling concepts such as periodic task execution, task prioritization, and task management.

## Assignment Structure
- The assignment is divided into four progressive problems, moving from basic task scheduling to advanced real-time applications.

## Suggested Tools and Resources
- Arduino IDE for development.
- Serial monitor for debugging.
- Libraries: TaskScheduler (https://github.com/arkhipenko/TaskScheduler) for
reference.
- Online Simulation platform using the provided library: https://wokwi.com/playground/task-scheduler.
- Microcontroller: Arduino Uno or similar with ATmega328 chip.

### Problems
1. **Problem-1:** Getting Started with TaskScheduler
2. **Problem-2:** Adding Task Control and Dependencies
3. **Problem-3:** Monitoring and Dynamic Task Addition
4. **Problem-4:** Building a Real-Time Application

## Outcome:
- This assignment provides hands-on experience with real-time scheduling concepts, task dependencies, dynamic task management, and applying these principles to real-world applications.
